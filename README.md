# Observer Hub

Observer Hub is a versatile project designed to facilitate the implementation of the Observer pattern. It enables users to define publisher and observer classes, specify allowed topics, and establish a user database. The system efficiently manages the Observer pattern, fostering seamless communication between publishers and observers while maintaining a structured database of users. This project serves as a centralized hub for orchestrating the interactions dictated by the Observer pattern in a well-organized and customizable manner.
